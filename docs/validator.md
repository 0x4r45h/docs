# Power-up Lava as a Validator

This section will help you start as a validator, step by step.
For additional help see the [FAQ Section](faq.md)

## What is a Validator?
Lava blockchain uses Proof-of-stake (PoS) as the consensus mechanism, based on [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/). Validators participate in the network by verifying new blocks to earn rewards.

LAVA holders are incentivized to stake their tokens to secure Lava while receiving a reward in return.
Validators earn LAVA from the creation of new blocks and the transaction fees, and on the other hand - slashing may occur to punish bad actors, all facilitated by Tendermint's consensus protocol. 

_Note_: This does not cover Delegating LAVA to validators


:::tip Start a validator - Auto _or_ Manual?
The sections below outlay both ways to start your validator, choose:

[<RoadmapItem icon="ðŸ¤–" title="Automatic scripts" description="If you want to get started first, and later on dive into specific subjects, that will work as well. The scripts are available as source code as well"/>](#auto)

[<RoadmapItem icon="ðŸ› " title="Manual steps" description="If you are already familiar with running validators, or love to orchestrate your own setup, this is the path for you"/>](#manual)
:::

## Start - ðŸ¤– Automatic scripts {#auto}

### 1. Install node (`lavad`) & Join network

**Prepare**
```bash
sudo apt update
``` 

```bash
sudo apt install curl unzip coreutils -y
```

**Install and join the network**

Running the script will:

1. Install `lavad`
2. Join the testnet
3. Sync to latest block

```bash
curl -s --location --request GET 'https://get.lavanet.xyz/pnet_join_network' --header 'Authorization: Basic OHRmem1Ta2VuSE1CajhwcDpSRXBhYWZmS2I3TTNQNlBt' > 00_join_network.sh && \
    chmod +x 00_join_network.sh && \
    ./00_join_network.sh production
```

### 2. Prepare an account & Fund it
If you don't have an account already, you can use this script to create one for you:

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://get.lavanet.xyz/pnet_run_node' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic OHRmem1Ta2VuSE1CajhwcDpSRXBhYWZmS2I3TTNQNlBt' > 01_run_node.sh && \
chmod +x 01_run_node.sh && \
./01_run_node.sh production create_account
```

Script finished? 
A. Copy the address from the script output and use the [faucets](./lava-blockchain/faucet.mdx) to receive LAVA.
B. Save securely the seed phrase that was created

(Example address: `lava@1xtlgz4nugxducwscc7zm2lkumagluf6jj8m599`)

### 3. Stake & start validating

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://get.lavanet.xyz/pnet_run_node' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic OHRmem1Ta2VuSE1CajhwcDpSRXBhYWZmS2I3TTNQNlBt' > 01_run_node.sh && \
chmod +x 01_run_node.sh && \
./01_run_node.sh production stake_validator
```


## Start - ðŸ›  Manual steps {#manual}

### 1. Install node (`lavad`) & Join network {#lavad}
Running as a validator requires a Lava Node running, Please refer to [our guide for joining **Testnet**](testnet) for details.

### 2. Prepare an account & Fund it
Lava account and wallets are standard Cosmos. Learn more in [Account & Wallet section](wallet).

Now that you decided you want to turn your node into a validator, you will first need to add a wallet to your keyring ([FAQ: what is a keyring](faq#keyring)).

While you can add an existing wallet through your seed phrase, we will create a new wallet in this example (replace $KEY_NAME with a name of your choosing):

```
lavad keys add $KEY_NAME
```

:::danger
Ensure you write down the mnemonic as you can not recover the wallet without it. 
:::

To ensure your wallet was saved to your keyring, look for the WALLET_NAME is in your keys list:

```
lavad keys list
```

The last thing needed before initializing the validator is to obtain your **validator public** key which was created when you first initialized your node. To obtain your validator pubkey:

```
lavad tendermint show-validator
```

Now you can receive test LAVA tokens using our [faucets](./lava-blockchain/faucet.mdx).

### 3. Stake & start validating {#create-validator}

Once your account is funded, run this to stake and start validating.

Note to set `$STAKE_AMOUNT` and `$KEY_NAME`:
```
lavad tx staking create-validator \
    --amount="$STAKE_AMOUNT" \
    --pubkey=$(lavad tendermint show-validator --home "$HOME/.lava/") \
    --chain-id=lava \
    --commission-rate="0.10" \
    --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
    --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
    --min-self-delegation="10000" \
    --gas="auto" \
    --gas-adjustment "1.5" \
    --gas-prices="0.0025ulava" \
    --from=$KEY_NAME
```

# What it means to be a provider
A Provider servicing APIs will register in the Lava Network as one, specifying which networks being relayed, and in what geolocations. 

To register as such, you will stake some `$lava` in every combination of Chain + Geolocation you will provide for. For example:

| Chain Spec            |      Geolocation      |  `$lava` stake    |
| -------------         | :-----------:         | ----:             |
| Ethereum Mainnet      | USA West              | 1,600             |
| Ethereum Mainnet      | Germany               | 2,000             |
| Ethereum Rinkby       | Germany               | 100               |

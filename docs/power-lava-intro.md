# Power-up the Lava Network

There are 3 core economic agents in the Lava Network: 
1. the Validators who secure the network, 
2. the Providers who run services for Developers, 
3. and the Developers who pay Providers for API access. 

All actors require LAVA tokens to perform their roles, and staking secures the network by aligning incentives. Lavaâ€™s model rewards Providers who provide a high quality of service, subjectively rated by each client [see QoS for more details], and punishes malicious or faulty behavior [see Conflict Detection and Resolution] e.g. providing unreliable data or persistent downtime. Additionally, there are End Users who use blockchain powered applications but do not pay for RPC usage. 

Lava Network is powered by its participants. Permissionless, trustless, P2P.

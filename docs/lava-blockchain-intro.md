# Lava Blockchain
This section will help you use or run a node yourself in Lava Blockchain.

Lava blockchain is built on the Cosmos SDK and offers new modules to support Lava's network.

## Running you own node vs connecting to one
In Lava, running a node is needed when you want to [be a validator](/validator-intro.md) in the network.

Connecting to an external node (a node running somewhere else) is possible, and can help you quick start if you want to [be a provider](/provider-intro), [access APIs in a decentralized way](/access-apis/direct-access.md), or just [query some data](/lava-blockchain/cli.md).

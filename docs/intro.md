# Lava Intro

Web3 is only as strong as its weakest link.
Today, due to complexities and lack of incentives to run your own node, apps rely on centralized services ü§∑

Lava is here to fix it. 
Access Lava, Access Web3.

## **What is Lava?**

Lava is decentralizing access to blockchain data. It is the first truly unstoppable protocol for blockchain API access.

Serving as a two-sided marketplace that incentivizes and coordinates blockchain nodes to provide dapps with blockchain data, Lava is setting the standard for fast, reliable, and secure API at scale.

### **How Does it work?**

Lava is built as an application-specific L1 PoS Blockchain, based on Cosmos and Tendermint.

Lava‚Äôs network is a Web3 APIs marketplace that acts as a settlement layer with dynamic pricing. On one side are developers & dapps (consumers) who need access to data or want to send transactions, and on the other are node runners (providers) that earn rewards for servicing requests.

**Why Lava?**

We are building the most reliable, and censorship-resistant network, which ensures high network performance and secure blockchain access. 

Lava and its community are building a network that can compete with centralized solutions all while retaining the core values of Web3.

 

**Quality of Service -** Consumers monitor and rate providers based on response time, availability and freshness. When asking for rewards, providers are required to attach their QoS score, and are rewarded accordingly.

**Data Reliability -** Providers are subject to fraud and fault detection checks, whereby the network uses statistical inference and verifiably random selections to compare the responses of multiple providers. If a conflict is detected, the network uses an honest majority of providers to attain who was wrong, penalizing the offender.

**Privacy & Anonymity -** Relays are randomly distributed between a changing list of providers, so consumers are less likely to get service from the same provider for a significant period of time. Consumer-provider communications happen directly and identities are not linked to Lava Wallets.

**Scalability -** Every aspect of Lava is being built with scalability in mind. A single-step reward system, aggregation, direct provider-dapp communication and staking incentives are designed to increase efficiency by sparing unnecessary stress from the network.

**Decentralized Access -** We encourage users to access our network in a fully decentralized way.
More on that soon üëÄ

**Open Source -** Lava as a public good. A base for developers to build on and draw inspiration from.

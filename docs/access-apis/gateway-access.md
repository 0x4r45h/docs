# Quick access Web3 APIs
Hop on to our gateway and access one of these chains now:

<RoadmapItem title="Asynchronous Tasks" description="Long-running or asynchronous tasks are a normal part of safely performing infrastructure maintenance. Clutch will track, execute, and report on jobs originating from Clutch workflows." />

<RoadmapItem title="Remote Execution" description="Safely run diagnostic commands across a cluster or set of resources.">

Sometimes an operator just needs a shell to diagnose a problem. Observability systems do not ingest granular data because it's expensive even though it's readily available from command line tools.

Clutch workflows may also require remote command execution in the event that an API does not otherwise exist for remote commands.

`fab` is common command-line tool for this purpose. However it's slow and the output is extremely difficult to follow when dealing with large numbers of resources.

# Lava Gateway

ðŸŒ‹ **Easy, self-serve access to any Web3 API, straight from the web browser, the Lava way ðŸ˜‰**

The Lava Gateway uses our Server Kit to provide a hosted point of access for developers looking for access through the Lava Network. This allows users to manage and configure Web3 API Access through an intuitive web interface directly from the browser. 

Hop on to our [gateway](https://gateway.lavanet.xyz/login) and access one of these chains now:

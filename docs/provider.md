# Be a Provider

This page covers what is a provider and the steps for starting as one.

## Intro - What is a provider
Providers service relay requests by staking on the network and running RPC nodes on the Relay Chains queried by Consumers (e.g. Cosmos, Ethereum, Osmosis, Polygon, etc). They earn fees in the form of LAVA from the Consumers for servicing requests.

## Available APIs
Lava scales constantly to new chains, and able to offer their APIs via our providers.
An API offering, for example "Ethereum Mainnet RPC" exist on-chain on the form a specification ("Spec"). These Specs, represent the interface along with metadata about it, for example supported protocols (REST API, JSON RPC...).
Specs are handled via Lava's governance.

### How to query available APIs/Chains? {#chains}

Get them directly from a lava node using the CLI (If you don't have the CLI yet, you'll be able to install it in the next section).

If you are running a node and connected to the testnet:
```
lavad q spec list-Spec
```
or if connecting to external node:
```
lavad q spec list-Spec --node https://54.144.69.182:26657
```

For reference, here's the result as of Sep-2022:
```
Ethereum - ETH1, jsonrpc  
Osmosis Mainnet - COS3, tendermintrpc  
Osmosis Mainnet - COS3, rest  
Fantom - FTM250, jsonrpc  
Goerli - GTH1, jsonrpc  
Lava mainnet - LAV1, tendermintrpc  
Lava mainnet - LAV1, rest 
Osmosis testnet - COS4, tendermintrpc  
Osmosis testnet - COS4, rest  
Celo mainnet - CELO, jsonrpc  
```

## Running a provider - steps
Being a provider requires alignment to the Lava protocol, for that, Lava has implemented an implementation to help you run it. That implementation is built inside `lavad`. 

:::info
 Current installation of `lavad` is built only for Linux. Soon we'll allow building lavad from source.
:::

### 1. Download `lavad`
```bash
binary_url="https://github.com/K433QLtr6RA9ExEq/GHFkqmTzpdNLDd6T/blob/main/production/cosmovisor-upgrades/genesis/bin/lavad?raw=true"
wget $binary_url -O $HOME/lavad
```

### 2. Prepare an account & Fund it {#account}
Lava account and wallets are standard Cosmos. Learn more in [Account & Wallet section](wallet).

First, you need to add a wallet to your keyring ([FAQ: what is a keyring](faq#keyring)).

While you may use your seed phrase to import an existing wallet, we'll make a new one in this scenario.
replace $ACCOUNT_NAME with a name of your choosing:

```bash
lavad keys add $ACCOUNT_NAME
```

To ensure your wallet was saved to your keyring, look for the `KEY_NAME` is in your keys list:

```bash
lavad keys list
```

:::caution Pencils out üìù
Keep the newly created account info:
1. SECRET mnemonic phrase üö®ü§´üö®ü§´üö®
2. Your public address, starts with `lava@`

:::

#### Faucet

Get your account funded through the faucet:
```bash
# Replace the address with your account address
curl -X POST \
-d '{"address": "lava@12h75m99wsgnxnc7d5qpwl6rq268c7jvccxdeqw", "coins": ["60000000ulava"]}' http://44.205.140.46:5555
# Expected success output: '{}'
```

#### Verify account funded

Verify that your account has funds in it in order to perform staking

```bash
# Make sure you can see your account name in the keys list
lavad keys list

# Make sure you see your account has Lava tokens in it
YOUR_ADDRESS=$($lavad keys show -a $ACCOUNT_NAME)

lavad query \
    bank balances \
    $YOUR_ADDRESS \
    --denom ulava
```
### 3. Stake a provider
To register as a Provider, you will stake some LAVA by specifying Chain + Geolocation you wish to provide for. An Example (using friendly texts for brevity):

| Chain Spec            |      Geolocation      |  LAVA stake    |
| -------------         | :-----------:         | ----:             |
| Ethereum Mainnet      | USA West              | 1,600             |
| Ethereum Mainnet      | Germany               | 2,000             |
| Ethereum Rinkby       | Germany               | 100               |

Each line above counts as a single service.
To stake a single service, use this command (see $arguments description below it)

```bash
lavad tx pairing stake-provider "$PROVIDER_NAME" \
    $STAKE_AMOUNT \
    "$SERVICED_NODE_IP:$SERVICED_NODE_PORT,$CHAIN_ID,1" 1 \
    -y \
    --from $ACCOUNT_NAME \
    --gas="auto" \
    --gas-adjustment "1.5" \
    --keyring-backend $keyring_backend \
    --node $RPC_NODE
```

Param description (and examples):
- `PROVIDER_NAME` - ...
- `STAKE_AMOUNT` - ...
- `SERVICED_NODE_IP` - IP of the node that will service the requests
- `SERVICED_NODE_PORT` - Port of the node that will service requests
- `CHAIN_ID` - The ID of the chain, see [how to query the full list](#chains). Example `COS4` or `FTM250`
- `ACCOUNT_NAME` - The address of the staking account
- `KEYRING_NAME` - The keyring to use
- `RPC_NODE` - If this `lavad` isn't synced with the network, you can use a remote node RPC address here


Notes:
1. Expected output code: `0`
2. Please stake provider only once per block (Block currently stands at 30s)

### 6. Run the provider processes

### 7. Verify the provider processes are running

## FAQ

### `lavad` not found  
Make sure you downloaded the binary, and it is located in the path you use to run `lavad` commands

### Received error `account sequence mismatch`
Try to wait for a block_time (current=30s) and then run the command again

### How do I unstake? {#unstake}
Run the following command:  
```
lavad tx pairing unstake-provider "$PROVIDER_NAME" \
    --from $ACCOUNT_NAME \
    --keyring-backend $keyring_backend \
    --node $RPC_NODE
```

Param description (and examples):
- `PROVIDER_NAME` - ...
- `ACCOUNT_NAME` - The unstaking account, example `lava@....`
- `RPC_NODE` - If this `lavad` isn't synced with the network, you can use a remote node RPC address here

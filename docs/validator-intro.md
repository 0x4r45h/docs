# Validator Introduction
Lava blockchain uses Proof-of-stake (PoS) as the consensus mechanism, based on [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/). Validators participate in the network by verifying new blocks to earn rewards.

LAVA holders are incentivized to stake their tokens to secure Lava, while receiving a reward in return. 

1. Run a Lava node
2. Stake LAVA, Start validating
3. earn LAVA rewards 

Validators earn LAVA from creation of new blocks and from the transaction fees, and on the other hand - slashing may occur to punish bad actors. 
all facilitated by Tendermint's consensus protocol. 

Note: Delegating LAVA to validators is not yet supported

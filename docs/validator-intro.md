# Validator Introduction
Lava blockchain uses Proof-of-stake (PoS) as the consensus mechanism, based on [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/). Validators participate in the network by verifying new blocks to earn rewards.

LAVA holders are incentivized to stake their tokens to secure Lava, while receiving a reward in return. 

1. Run a Lava node
2. Stake your LAVA
3. earn LAVA rewards

Validators earn LAVA from creation of new blocks and from the transaction fees, and on the other hand - slashing may occur to punish bad actors. 
all facilitated by Tendermint's consensus protocol.

Delegating LAVA to validators is not yet supported

## Requirements
### Minimum Stake
A minimum stake of _ LAVA is required.

### Hardware Requirements

As the network grows, bandwidth, CPU, and memory requirements rise. Large hard drives are recommended for storing years of blockchain history, as well as significant RAM to process the increasing amount of transactions.

Also, running on testnet and mainnet will feature differ requirements.

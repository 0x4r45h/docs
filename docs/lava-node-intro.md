# Run a Node
This section will help you setup a node to access the Lava blockchain.

**There are 3 options to access a Lava node:**
1. [Use installer](/lava-node/node-use-installer.md) (common for most users)
2. [Build source](/lava-node/node-build-source.md) (common for code contributors)
3. [Connect remote](/lava-node/node-connect-remote.md) (misc usages)

## How to choose?

:::note Powering Lava? üåã
- Want to [be a validator](/validator-intro.md)? Use option [1. Installer](/lava-node/node-use-installer.md)

## Requirements

### Hardware

As the network grows, bandwidth, CPU, and memory requirements rise. Large hard drives are recommended for storing years of blockchain history, as well as significant RAM to process the increasing amount of transactions.

Also, running on testnet and mainnet will feature differ requirements.

**Recommended testnet**:

| Node Type     | RAM                   | Storage       | CPU
| -----------   | --------------------- | -----------   | ---
| Full          | 8GB                   | 100GB SSD          | x64 2.0 GHz 4v CPU

### Operating system
- For using the installer - you need to run **`Ubuntu` - `20`** or newer.
- sudo permissions on your machine (e.g. can run `sudo hostname`)

- Inbound - open the following ports:
    - 1317 - REST
    - 26657 - TENDERMINT_RPC
    - 26656 - Cosmos
    - *Provider specific ports*:
        - 2221 - provider port
        - 22231 - provider port
        - 2241 - provider port

## Deployment options
- VPS instance (on any cloud provider) - recommended ‚≠êÔ∏è
- Shared compute instance (e.g. AWS EC2 instance)
- Your personal station - less recommended
